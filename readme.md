## Full-stack Restaurant Application

This application was made using Nodejs, Express, MongoDB and some other node packages.
It is a full-stack application that does the usual CRUD operations, handles ajax requests
and also makes use of the Google Maps API to show some nice map data.
Special thanks to Wes Bos for the amazing tutorial. Probably the best tutorial on learning Node.
